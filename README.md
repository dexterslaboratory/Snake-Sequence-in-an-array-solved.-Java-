# Snake-Sequence-in-an-array-solved.-Java-
 A set of numbers separated by space is passed as input. The program must print the largest snake sequence present in the numbers. A snake sequence is made up of adjacent numbers such that for each number, the number on the right or left is +1 or -1 of it's value. If multiple snake sequences of maximum length is possible print the snake sequence appearing in the natural input order.
